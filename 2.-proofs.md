# 2. Proofs

## Introduction

A mathematical proof provides <mark style="color:$success;">a means for guaranteeing that a statement is true</mark>.

To be certain that the statement is true, we must provide a <mark style="color:$success;">rigorous</mark> proof.

So what is a proof? <mark style="color:red;">A proof is a finite sequence of steps, called logical deductions, which establishes the truth of a desired statement.</mark> In particular, <mark style="color:red;">**the power of a proof lies in the fact that using finite means, we can guarantee the truth of a statement with infinitely many cases**</mark><mark style="color:red;">.</mark>

Starting from these axioms, a proof consists of a sequence of logical deductions: Simple steps that apply the rules of logic. This results in a sequence of statements where each successive statement is necessarily true if the previous statements were true.&#x20;

We next introduce four different proof techniques:&#x20;

* Direct proof (Section 3),&#x20;
* proof by contraposition (Section 4),&#x20;
* proof by contradiction (Section 5),&#x20;
* proof by cases (Section 6).&#x20;

## Notation

* Recall that the sum or product of two integers is an integer, i.e., the set of integers is closed under addition and multiplication.&#x20;
* Given integers a and b, we say that a divides b (denoted a|b) if there exists an integer q such that b= aq.
* we use the notation := to indicate a definition. For example, q := 6 defines variable q as having value 6.

## Background

* Integers closed under addition. $$a,b \in Z  \implies a+b \in Z$$
* a|b means “a divides b”. Formally: $$a|b \iff  \exists  q \in Z \, where \, b = aq$$
* A natural number p > 1, is prime if it is divisible only by 1 and itself.

## Proof by Contradiction

$$\lnot P \implies \lnot R \land R$$, the contrapositon is $$TRUE \implies P$$.

**Theorem**: $$\sqrt 2$$ is irrational.

**Theorem**: There are infinitely many primes.

## Proof by Cases

Specifically, the idea behind a proof by cases is as follows: <mark style="color:$warning;">Sometimes when we wish to prove a claim, we don’t know which of a set of possible cases is true, but we know that at least one of the cases is true</mark>. What we can do then is to <mark style="color:$warning;">prove the result in both cases; then, clearly the general statement must hold</mark>.

&#x20;lemmas and theorems is not clear-cut. Usually, when writing a paper, the <mark style="color:$success;">theorems</mark> are those propositions that you want to <mark style="color:$warning;">“export” from the paper to the rest of the world</mark>, whereas the <mark style="color:$success;">lemmas</mark> are propositions <mark style="color:$warning;">used locally in the proofs of your theorems</mark>.

## Principle of Induction

Why making "Induction Hypothesis" is not using what i am assuming to prove what i am proving?

Becuase we are not using $$P(k)$$ to prove $$P(k)$$,  $$P(k)$$ and  $$P(k+1)$$ are different statements, we are using $$P(k)$$ to prove $$P(k+1)$$.
