# Proofs

## Introduction

A mathematical proof provides a means for guaranteeing that a statement is true.

To be certain that the statement is true, we must provide a rigorous proof.

So what is a proof? A proof is a finite sequence of steps, called logical deductions, which establishes the truth of a desired statement. In particular, the power of a proof lies in the fact that using finite means, we can guarantee the truth of a statement with infinitely many cases.

Starting from these axioms, a proof consists of a sequence of logical deductions: Simple steps that apply the rules of logic. This results in a sequence of statements where each successive statement is necessarily true if the previous statements were true.&#x20;

We next introduce four different proof techniques:&#x20;

* Direct proof (Section 3),&#x20;
* proof by contraposition (Section 4),&#x20;
* proof by contradiction (Section 5),&#x20;
* proof by cases (Section 6).&#x20;

## Notation

* Recall that the sum or product of two integers is an integer, i.e., the set of integers is closed under addition and multiplication.&#x20;
* Given integers a and b, we say that a divides b (denoted a|b) iff there exists an integer q such that b= aq.
* we use the notation := to indicate a definition. For example, q := 6 defines variable q as having value 6.

## Proof by Cases

Specifically, the idea behind a proof by cases is as follows: Sometimes when we wish to prove a claim, we don’t know which of a set of possible cases is true, but we know that at least one of the cases is true. What we can do then is to prove the result in both cases; then, clearly the general statement must hold.



&#x20;lemmas and theorems is not clear-cut. Usually, when writing a paper, the theorems are those propositions that you want to “export” from the paper to the rest of the world, whereas the lemmas are propositions used locally in the proofs of your theorems.
