# 3. Induction

## Principle of Induction

$$P(0) \land (\forall n \in N ) P(n) \implies P(n + 1)$$

Then we get:

$$( \forall n \in N) P(n)$$.

“But aren’t you starting with the statement to prove the statement?”

In general, ∀n ∈N P(n) ̸≡P(n + 1).

“P(n)” is “different” statement than “P(n + 1)” <mark style="color:$danger;">for any fixed n</mark>.

## Two color theorem: example.

Any map formed by dividing the plane into regions by drawing straight lines can be properly colored with two colors.

Fact: Swapping red and blue gives another valid colors.

### Base Case.

1\. Add line.

2\. Get inherited color for split regions

3\. <mark style="color:$danger;">Switch on one side</mark> of new line.(Fixes conflicts along line, and makes no new ones.)

Algorithm gives $$P(k) \implies P(k + 1)$$.

{% hint style="danger" %}
This induction process give out an algorithm, to color the map, which is very important in algorithm design in computer science.This is recursion.

## Strenthening Induction Hypothesis

<mark style="color:$danger;">Assume more to make the prove more powerful.</mark>

**Theorem: The sum of the first n odd numbers is a perfect square.**

<mark style="color:$success;">Theorem: The sum of the first n odd numbers is</mark> $$n^2$$

k th odd number is 2(k−1) + 1.

Base Case 1 (first odd number) is 12

Induction Hypothesis Sum of first k odds is perfect square a2 = k 2

Induction Step 1. The (k + 1)st odd number is 2k + 1.

2\. Sum of the first k + 1 odds is

a2 + 2k + 1= k 2 + 2k + 1

3\. k 2 + 2k + 1= (k + 1)2

... P(k+1)!

you want to prove some therom, and it does not work out, maybe you want to prove a slighter stronger therom.

With the stronger therom, then you can use the stronger statement as your induction hypothethys, to help you build up a proof.

## Strong Induction

Theorem: Every natural number n > 1 can be written as a (possibly trivial) product of primes.

Definition: A prime n has exactly 2 factors 1 and n.

**Base Case**: n = 2.

**Induction Step**:

P(n) =“n can be written as a product of primes. “Either n + 1 is a prime or n + 1= a·b where 1 < a, b < n + 1.

P(n) says nothing about a, b!

### Strong Induction Principle:

<mark style="color:$success;">If</mark> $$P(0)$$ and $$(\forall k \in N)((P(0)  \land . . . \land P(k ))  \implies P(k + 1))$$,

<mark style="color:$success;">then</mark> $$(\forall k \in N)(P(k ))$$.

&#x20;P(0) ⇒P(1) ⇒P(2) ⇒P(3) ⇒···

### Strong induction hypothesis:&#x20;

“a and b are products of primes” ⇒ “n + 1= a·b = (factorization of a (factorization of b)”

n + 1 can be written as the product of the prime factors!

## <mark style="color:$danger;">Well Ordering Principle</mark> and Induction.

If (∀n)P(n) is not true, then (∃n)¬P(n). (find one case which does not fit)

Consider smallest m, with¬P(m), m ≥0

P(m−1) ⇒P(m) must be false (assuming P(0) holds.)

This is a proof of the induction principle!

I.e., (¬∀n)P(n) ⇒ ((∃n)¬(P(n−1) ⇒P(n)).

Not all n, P(n) is true. Which means there exists n, P(n-1) ⇒ P(n) is not true.

(<mark style="color:$success;">Contrapositive of Induction principle</mark> (assuming P(0))

$$P(0) \land (\forall n \in N ) P(n) \implies P(n + 1)$$&#x20;

⇒

&#x20;$$( \forall n \in N) P(n)$$



$$P(0) \land (\forall n ) P(n) \implies P(n + 1)$$&#x20;

⇒

&#x20;$$( \forall n) P(n)$$



<mark style="color:$success;">Contrapositive</mark> (Use Analogous laws):

&#x20;$$\lnot  (( \forall n) P(n))$$ ⇒ $$\lnot (P(0) \land (\forall n ) P(n) \implies P(n + 1))$$

&#x20;$$( \exists n) \lnot P(n)$$ ⇒ $$\lnot P(0) \lor (\exists n ) \lnot (P(n) \implies P(n + 1))$$

<mark style="color:$danger;">It assumes that there is a smallest m where P(m) does not hold.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">The Well ordering principle states that for any subset of the natural numbers there is a smallest element.</mark>

Smallest may not be what you expect: the well ordering principal holds for rationals but with different ordering!!

E.g. Reduced form is “smallest” representation of rational number a/b.

**数学归纳法** 依赖于 N的良序性：

* 证明“若命题 P(n) 对 n=0 成立，且 P(k) 成立可推出 P(k+1)成立，则 P(n)对所有 n∈N 成立”时，本质是利用了 N 的子集若无反例，必有最小反例的矛盾。
{% endhint %}

<mark style="color:$info;">Think of the first smallest counter example and prove that it can't exsit.</mark>

<mark style="color:$info;">It is another phrasing of induction,</mark>

When you want to prove something by induction, you can use regular induction, strong induction, and go up. But you can also say, look <mark style="color:$primary;">there is no smallest counter example, therefore it must be true for everything</mark>. And you get to use the word SMALLEST, that very powerful.

## Example:

Thm: All natural numbers are interesting.

0 is interesting...

Let n be the first uninteresting number.

But n−1 is interesting and n is uninteresting,

so n is the first uninteresting number.

But being first is interesting!

Thus, there is no smallest uninteresting natural number.

Thus: All natural numbers are interesting.





## Tournaments have short cycles

**Def:** A round robin tournament on n players: every player p plays every other player q, and either p →q (p beats q) or q →p (q beats p.)

**Def:** A cycle: a sequence of p1, . . . , pk , pi →pi+1 and pk →p1.

**Theorem**: Any tournament that has a cycle has <mark style="color:$info;">a cycle of length 3</mark>.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Proof:**

Assume the the <mark style="color:$warning;">smallest</mark> cycle is of length k.

* Case 1: Of length 3. Done.
* Case 2: Of length larger than 3.
  * Case 1: “p3 →p1” ⇒ 3 cycle (Contradiction).
  * Case 2: “p1 →p3” ⇒ k−1 length cycle! (Contradicts assumption of smallest k !)

Only case 1 holds, then the proof ends.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Def**: A Hamiltonian path: a sequence p1, . . . , pn, (∀i, 0 ≤i < n) pi →pi+1.

**Thm**: Every tournament has a Hamiltonian path.

Tournament on n + 1 people,

Remove arbitrary person p →yield tournament on n−1 people.

By induction hypothesis: There is a sequence p1, . . . , pn

contains all the people where pi →pi+1

If p is big winner, put at beginning. Big loser at end.

If neither, find first place i, where p beats pi.

p1, . . . , pi−1, p, pi , . . . pn is Hamiltonion path

## Horses of the same color...

**Theorem**: All horses have the same color.

**1, Induction**:

* **Base Case**: P(1) - trivially true.
* **Induction Hypothesis**: P(k ) - Any k horses have the same color.
* **Induction step P(k + 1)?**
  * First k have same color by P(k ).&#x20;
  * Last k have same color by P(k ).&#x20;
  * A horse in the middle in common!&#x20;
  * All k must have the same color.&#x20;

2, How about P(1) ⇒P(2)?

* **Induction step P(2)**
  * First 1 have same color by P(k ).&#x20;
  * Last 1 have same color by P(k ).&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:$danger;">No horse in common!</mark>
  * P(2) is false

**3,** Fix base case.

* **New Base Case:** P(2): there are two horses with same color. (Which  is true)
* <mark style="color:$danger;">There are</mark> two horses is ̸≡ <mark style="color:$danger;">For all</mark> two horses!!!

As we will see, it is more subtle to catch errors in proofs of correct theorems!!

## Sad Islanders...

### **1, Background**

* Island with 100 possibly blue-eyed and green-eyed inhabitants.
* Any islander who knows they have green eyes must do bad ritual that day.
* No islander knows there own eye color, but knows everyone elses.
* All islanders have green eyes!
* First rule of island: Don’t talk about eye color!

**Visitor:** “I see someone has green eyes.”

**Result:** On day 100, they all do the ritual.

### <mark style="color:$warning;">2, Why?</mark>

**Thm:** If there are n villagers with green eyes they do ritual on day n.

**Proof:**

* **Base**: n = 1. Person with green eyes does ritual on day 1.&#x20;
  * Total 100 people, the green eyed persion knows that there are green eyes because what the visitor said.&#x20;
  * But no one is doing the ritual on day 1, and I know others are blue eyed
  * Then it must be me. So I have to do the ritual on day 1
* **Induction hypothesis**: If n people with green eyes, they do ritual on day n.
* **Induction step**:
  * On day n + 1, a green eyed person sees n people with green eyes.
  * But they didn’t do the ritual. (Then there must not be n green eyes, because what the hypothesis says)
  * So <mark style="color:$success;">there must be n + 1 people with green eyes</mark>.
  * One of them is me.

Wait a second! Visitor added no information.

## Common Knowledge.

Using knowledge about what other people’s knowledge (your eye color) is.

On day 1, everyone knows everyone sees more than zero.

On day 2, everyone knows everyone sees more than one.

. . .

On day 99, no one sees 98 since everyone knows everyone else does not see 97...(<mark style="color:$danger;">????</mark>)

On day 100, ...uh oh!

**Related example:**

Emperor’s new clothes!

Maybe: No one knows other people see that he has no clothes.

Until kid points it out.

## Summary: principle of induction.

$$(P(0) \land (\forall k \in N ) (P(k) \implies P(k + 1)))) \implies (\forall n \in N)(P(n))$$

Statement to prove: P(n) for n starting from n0

* Base Case: Prove P(n0).
* Ind. Step: Prove. For all values, n ≥n0, P(n) ⇒P(n + 1).

Statement is proven!

### Strong Induction:

$$(P(0) \land (\forall n \in N)(P(0) \land P(1) \land ···P(n)) \implies P(n + 1))))$$

$$\implies (\forall n \in N)(P(n))$$

Also Today: **strengthened induction hypothesis**.

* Strengthen theorem statement.
* Sum of first n odds is n^2

Hole anywhere.

Not same as strong induction. E.g., used in product of primes proof.

<mark style="color:$success;">Induction ≡Recursion.</mark>

$$(P(0)  \land ((\forall k \in N)(P(k ) \implies P(k + 1))))  \implies (\forall n \in N)(P(n))$$

Another Variation:

Different Starting Point:

$$(P(1) \land ((\forall n \in N)((n ≥1) \land P(n)) \implies P(n + 1))))$$

$$\implies (\forall n \in N)((n ≥1) \implies P(n))$$

Statement to prove: P(n) for n starting from n0

Base Case: Prove P(n0).

Ind. Step: Prove. For all values, n ≥n0, P(n) = ⇒P(n + 1).

Statement is proven!

Example:

Coins of value 4 and 7, can be used to make any value higher than 11.

P(“zero′′) here is P(11), and prove for ∀n ≥11 P(n) ⇒P(n + 1).
