# 4. Stable Marriage

## Some quibbles.

The induction principle works on the natural numbers.

* Proves statements of form: ∀n ∈N, P(n).
* What if the statement is only for n ≥3?
  * ∀n ∈N, (n ≥3) ⇒P(n), Restate as: ∀n ∈N, Q(n) where Q(n) =“(n ≥3) ⇒P(n)”.
  * Base Case: typically start at 3. Since ∀n ∈N, Q(n) ⇒Q(n + 1) is trivially true before 3.
* Can you do induction over other things? Yes. <mark style="color:$info;">Any set where any subset of the set has a smallest element</mark>.

## Strong Induction and Recursion.

**Thm:** For every natural number n ≥12, n = 4x + 5y.

Instead of proof, let’s write some code!

```
def find-x-y(n):
    if (n==12) return (3,0)
    elif (n==13): return(2,1)
    elif (n==14): return(1,2)
    elif (n==15): return(0,3)
else:
    (x’,y’) = find-x-y(n-4)
    return(x’+1,y’)
```

* Base cases: P(12) , P(13) , P(14) , P(15). Yes.
* Strong Induction step: Recursive call is correct: P(n−4) ⇒ P(n).
  * n−4= 4x′+ 5y′⇒n = 4(x′+ 1) + 5(y′)

Slight differences: showed for all n ≥16 that $$∧_{i=4}^{n−1} P(i) \implies P(n)$$.

## Strengthening: need to...

Theorem: For all n ≥1, $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac {1} {i^2} \leq 2$$. ($$S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac {1} {i^2}$$)

* Base: $$P(1)$$. 1 ≤2.
* Ind Step: $$\sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac {1} {i^2} \leq 2$$
  * $$\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} \frac {1} {i^2}$$$$=\sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac {1} {i^2} + \frac{1}{(k+1)^2}$$$$\leq 2+ \frac{1}{(k+1)^2}$$

Got stuck!!!

Hmmm... It better be that any sum is strictly less than 2.

How much less? At least by $$\frac {1}{(k+1)^2}$$for $$S_k$$

$$"S_k \leq 2 - \frac {1}{(k+1)^2}" \implies "S_{k+1} \leq 2"$$

Induction step works! <mark style="color:$danger;">No! Not the same statement!!!!</mark>

Need to prove $$S_{k+1} \leq 2 - \frac {1}{(k+2)^2}$$

Darn!!!

## Strenthening: how?

Theorem: For all n ≥1, $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac {1} {i^2} \leq 2-f(n)$$. ($$S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac {1} {i^2}$$)

**Proof**:

* Ind hyp: $$P(k ) — “S_k ≤2−f (k )”$$
* Prove: $$P(k + 1) – “S_{k +1} ≤2−f (k + 1)”$$
  * $$S_{k +1} = S_k + \frac {1}{(k+1)^2} \leq 2 - f(k) + \frac {1}{(k+1)^2}$$ By ind. hyp.

Choose $$f(k+1) \leq f(k) - \frac {1}{(k+1)^2}$$

$$\implies S(k+1) \leq 2-f(k+1)$$

Can you?

Subtracting off a quadratically decreasing function every time. Maybe a linearly decreasing function to keep positive?

Try $$f(k) = \frac {1}{k}$$

$$\frac {1}{k+1} \leq \frac{1}{k} - \frac {1}{(k+1)^2}$$?

$$1 \leq \frac{k+1}{k} - \frac{1}{k+1}$$, Multiplied by k+1

$$1 \leq 1 +(\frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{k+1})$$, Some math. So yes!

Theorem: For all n ≥1, $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac {1} {i^2} \leq 2-\frac{1}{n}$$

## Stable Marriage Problem

* Small town with n boys and n girls.
* Each girl has <mark style="color:$info;">a ranked preference list</mark> of boys.
* Each boy has <mark style="color:$info;">a ranked preference list</mark> of girls.

How should they be matched?

## Count the ways..

* Maximize total satisfaction.
* Maximize number of first choices.
* Maximize worse off.
* Minimize difference between preference ranks.

## The best laid plans..

Consider the couples..

* Jennifer and Brad
* Angelina and Billy-Bob

Brad prefers Angelina to Jennifer.

Angelina prefers Brad to BillyBob.

Uh..oh.

## So..

Produce a pairing where there is no running off!

**Definition**: A **pairing** is disjoint set of n boy-girl pairs.

Example: A pairing S= {(Brad , Jen); (BillyBob, Angelina)}.

**Definition**: A **rogue couple** b, g∗for a pairing S:

b and g∗prefer each other to their partners in S

Example: Brad and Angelina are a rogue couple in S.

## A stable pairing??

Given a set of preferences.

Is there a stable pairing?

How does one find it?

Consider a single gender version: stable roommates.

## The Traditional Marriage Algorithm.

Each Day:

1. Each boy <mark style="color:$info;">**proposes**</mark> to his favorite girl on his list.
2. Each girl rejects all but her favorite proposer (whom she puts on a <mark style="color:$info;">string</mark>.)
3. Rejected boy <mark style="color:$info;">crosses</mark> rejecting girl off his list.

Stop when each girl gets exactly one proposal.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (18).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Termination.

<mark style="color:$info;">Every non-terminated day a boy crossed an item off the list</mark>.

Total size of lists? n boys, n length list. n2

Terminates in at most n2 + 1 steps!

## It gets better every day for girls..

**Improvement Lemma**: **It just gets better for girls**.

If on day t a girl g has a boy b on a string,

any boy, b′, on g’s string for any day t′> t is at least as good as b.



Let’s apply lemma.

* Girl “Alice” has boy “Bob” on string on day 5.
* She has boy “Jim” on string on day 7.
* Does Alice prefer “Jim” or “Bob”?

g - ’Alice’, b - ’Bob’, b′- ’Jim’, t= 5, t′ = 7.

<mark style="color:$success;">Improvement Lemma says she prefers ’Jim’.</mark>

On day 10, could Alice still have “Jim” on her string? Yes.

She likes her day 10 boy at least as much as her day 7 boy.

Here, b= b′.



Why is lemma true?

Proof Idea: Because she can always keep the previous boy on the string.

## Improvement Lemma

**Improvement Lemma: It just gets better for girls.**

If on day t a girl g has a boy b on a string, any boy, b′, on g’s string for any day t′> t is at least as good as b.

Proof:

P(k )- - “boy on g’s string is at least as good as b on day t + k”

P(0)– true. Girl has b on string.

Assume P(k ). Let b′be boy on string on day t + k.

On day t + k + 1, boy b′comes back.

Girl can choose b′, or do better with another boy, b′′

That is, b′≤b by induction hypothesis.

And b′′is better than b′by algorithm.⇒ Girl does at least as well as with b.

P(k )  ⇒P(k + 1). And by principle of induction.

## Pairing when done.

**Lemma**: Every boy is matched at end.

**Proof**:

If not, <mark style="color:$danger;">a boy b must have been rejected n times</mark>.

Every girl has been proposed to by b, and Improvement lemma ⇒ each girl has a boy on a string.

and each boy is on at most one string.

n girls and n boys. Same number of each.

<mark style="color:$danger;">⇒ b must be on some girl’s string!</mark>

<mark style="color:$danger;">Contradiction.</mark>

## Pairing is Stable.

**Lemma**: There is no rogue couple for the pairing formed by

traditional marriage algorithm.

**Proof**:

Assume there is a rogue couple; (b, g∗)

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (19).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Boy b proposes to g∗before proposing to g.

So g∗rejected b (since he moved on)

By improvement lemma, <mark style="color:$danger;">g∗likes b∗better than b</mark>.

<mark style="color:$danger;">Contradiction!</mark>

## Good for boys? girls?

Is the TMA better for boys? for girls?

* **Definition**: A pairing is **x-optimal** if x′s partner is x’s best partner in any stable pairing.
* **Definition**: A pairing is **x-pessimal** if x′s partner is x’s worst partner in any stable pairing.
* **Definition**: A pairing is boy optimal if it is x-optimal for all boys x.

..and so on for boy pessimal, girl optimal, girl pessimal.

<mark style="color:$danger;">Claim: Optimal partner for a boy must be first in his preference list.</mark>

True? False? False!

Subtlety here: Best partner in any <mark style="color:$danger;">stable</mark> pairing. As well as you can be in a globally stable solution!

<mark style="color:$info;">Question: Is there a boy or girl optimal pairing?</mark>

Is it possible:

b-optimal pairing different from the b′-optimal pairing!

Yes? No?

## Understanding Optimality: by example.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (21).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Consider pairing: (A, 1), (B, 2).

* Stable? Yes.
* Optimal for B?
  * Notice: only one stable pairing.
  * So this is the best B can do in a stable pairing.
  * So optimal for B.

Also optimal for A, 1 and 2. Also pessimal for A,B,1 and 2.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (22).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Pairing S: (A, 1), (B, 2). Stable? Yes.
* Pairing T : (A, 2), (B, 1). Also Stable.
* Which is optimal for A? S Which is optimal for B? S
* Which is optimal for 1? T Which is optimal for 2? T

## TMA is optimal for one gender!

For boys? For girls?

**Theorem: TMA produces a boy-optimal pairing.**

**Proof**:

* Assume not:
  * Some boy b not paired with optimal girl, g in TMA pairing T.
  * <mark style="color:$danger;">There is a stable pairing</mark> S <mark style="color:$danger;">where b and g are paired</mark>.

<mark style="color:$info;">Let t be first day</mark> a boy <mark style="color:$info;">b</mark> gets rejected by his optimal girl g who he is paired with in stable pairing <mark style="color:$info;">S</mark>.

b∗- knocks b off of g’s string on day t⇒ <mark style="color:$info;">g prefers b∗to b</mark>

By choice of t, b∗likes g at least as much as optimal girl.

⇒ <mark style="color:$info;">b∗prefers g to his partner g∗in S</mark>.

<mark style="color:$danger;">Rogue couple for S.</mark>

<mark style="color:$danger;">So S is not a stable pairing. Contradiction.</mark>

Notes: S - stable. (b∗, g∗)and (b, g) ∈S. But (b∗, g) is rogue couple!

Used Well-Ordering principle...Induction.

## How about for girls?

**Theorem: TMA** produces girl-pessimal pairing.

T – pairing produced by TMA.

<mark style="color:$danger;">S</mark> – worse <mark style="color:$danger;">stable pairing</mark> for girl g.

In T , (g, b) is pair.

In S, (g, b∗) is pair.

<mark style="color:$info;">g likes b∗less than she likes b.</mark>

T is boy optimal, so <mark style="color:$info;">b likes g more than his partner in S.</mark>

<mark style="color:$info;">(g, b) is Rogue couple for S</mark>

<mark style="color:$danger;">S is not stable.</mark>

<mark style="color:$danger;">Contradiction.</mark>

Notes: Not really induction.

Structural statement: Boy optimality⇒ Girl pessimality.

## Quick Questions.

How does one make it better for girls?

* SMA - stable marriage algorithm. One side proposes.
* TMA - boys propose.
* Girls could propose.⇒ optimal for girls.

## Residency Matching..

The method was used to match residents to hospitals.

Hospital optimal....

..until 1990’s...Resident optimal.

Another variation: couples.
