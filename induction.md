# Induction

Principle of Induction.

P(0) ∧(∀n ∈N)P(n) = ⇒P(n + 1)

Then we get:

(∀n ∈N)P(n).

“But aren’t you starting with the statement to prove the statement?”

Start with statement P(n) and prove P(n + 1).

Is this a statement or a predicate?

A little subtle;

we fix the natural number n (bind n in ∀n.)
