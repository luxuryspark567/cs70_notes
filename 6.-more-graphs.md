# 6. More Graphs

## Planarity and Euler

These graphs cannot be drawn in the plane without edge crossings.

Euler’s Formula: v + f= e + 2 for any connected planar drawing.

\= ⇒ for simple planar graphs: e ≤3v−6.

Idea: Face is a cycle in graph of length 3.

Count face-edge incidences to “eliminate” f.

\= ⇒ for bipartite simple planar graphs: e ≤2v−4.

Idea: face is a cycle in graph of length 4.

Count face-edge incidences.

Proved absolutely no drawing can work for these graphs.

So......so ...Cool!
