# 6. More Graphs

## Planarity and Euler

These graphs cannot be drawn in the plane without edge crossings.

Euler’s Formula: **v + f= e + 2** for any connected planar drawing.

\= ⇒ for simple planar graphs: e ≤3v−6.

Idea: Face is a cycle in graph of length 3.

Count face-edge incidences to “eliminate” f.

⇒ for bipartite simple planar graphs: e ≤2v−4.

Idea: face is a cycle in graph of length 4.

Count face-edge incidences.

Proved absolutely no drawing can work for these graphs.

So......so ...Cool!

## Euler’s formula.

**Euler: Connected planar graph has v + f= e + 2.**

<mark style="color:$danger;">Proof: Induction on e.</mark>

**Base:** e = 0, v = f= 1.

**Induction Hypothesis:** Connected planar graph with e edges has v + f = e + 2

**Induction Step:**

* If it is a tree. Done.
* If not a tree.
  * Find a cycle. Remove edge.
  * Joins two faces.
  * New graph: v -vertices. e−1 edges. f−1 faces. Planar.
  * v + (f−1) = (e−1) + 2 by induction hypothesis.
  * Therefore v + f= e + 2.

## Graph Coloring.

Given G = (V , E), a coloring of G assigns colors to vertices V where

for each edge the endpoints have different colors.

Notice that the last one, has one three colors.

Fewer colors than number of vertices.

Lemma: Any graph with maximum degree d can be d + 1 colored.

Proof: True for 1 vertex. Color n vertex graph with d + 1 colors?

Remove vertex, v.

Color remaining graph with d + 1 colors by induction hypothesis.

Set of neighbors of v use at most d colors,

one color is available for v.

Last graph:

Fewer colors than max degree node.

Interesting things to do. Algorithm!

## Six color theorem.

Theorem: Every planar graph can be colored with six colors.

Proof:

Recall: $$e ≤3v−6$$ for any planar graph where v > 2. From Euler’s Formula.

**Base Cases:** for $$v \leq 6$$ can be colored with 6

**Induction Hypothesis:** Every planar graph with $$v \leq 6$$ can be colored with six colors.

**Induction Steps:**

Total degree: $$2e$$

Average degree:=$$\frac {2e} {v} \leq \frac {2(3v-6)} {v} \leq 6-\frac {12} {v}$$

<mark style="color:$warning;">There exists a vertex with degree < 6 or at most 5. (if not, then average degree will larger or equal than 5)</mark>

Remove vertex v of degree at most 5.

<mark style="color:$danger;">Inductively color remaining graph with 6 colors.</mark>

Color is available for v since only five neighbors...

and only five colors are used.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can see the progress  as program

You know you can find a vetex with degree 5, and you can remove it

You know you can do the recursive call on the graph with fewer vertexes, proper colored

Then you put the removed vetex back to the graph, and you know how to fix the corloring.

You do the recursive leap of faith, then do the work to make extended solution to this one node.
