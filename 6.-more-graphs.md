# 6. More Graphs

## Planarity and Euler

These graphs cannot be drawn in the plane without edge crossings.

Euler’s Formula: **v + f= e + 2** for any connected planar drawing.

\= ⇒ for simple planar graphs: e ≤3v−6.

Idea: Face is a cycle in graph of length 3.

Count face-edge incidences to “eliminate” f.

⇒ for bipartite simple planar graphs: e ≤2v−4.

Idea: face is a cycle in graph of length 4.

Count face-edge incidences.

Proved absolutely no drawing can work for these graphs.

So......so ...Cool!

## Euler’s formula.

**Euler: Connected planar graph has v + f= e + 2.**

<mark style="color:$danger;">Proof: Induction on e.</mark>

**Base:** e = 0, v = f= 1.

**Induction Hypothesis:** Connected planar graph with e edges has v + f = e + 2

**Induction Step:**

* If it is a tree. Done.
* If not a tree.
  * Find a cycle. Remove edge.
  * Joins two faces.
  * New graph: v -vertices. e−1 edges. f−1 faces. Planar.
  * v + (f−1) = (e−1) + 2 by induction hypothesis.
  * Therefore v + f= e + 2.

## Graph Coloring.

Given G = (V , E), a coloring of G assigns colors to vertices V where for each edge the endpoints have different colors.

Notice that the last one, has one three colors.

Fewer colors than number of vertices.

**Lemma:** Any graph with maximum degree d can be d + 1 colored.

Proof: True for 1 vertex. Color n vertex graph with d + 1 colors?

Remove vertex, v.

Color remaining graph with d + 1 colors by induction hypothesis.

Set of neighbors of v use at most d colors,

one color is available for v.

Last graph:

Fewer colors than max degree node.

Interesting things to do. Algorithm!

## Planar graphs and maps.

Planar graph coloring ≡map coloring.

Four color theorem is about planar graphs!

## Six color theorem.

Theorem: Every planar graph can be colored with six colors.

Proof:

Recall: $$e ≤3v−6$$ for any planar graph where v > 2. From Euler’s Formula.

**Base Cases:** for $$v \leq 6$$ can be colored with 6

**Induction Hypothesis:** Every planar graph with $$v \geq 6$$ can be colored with six colors.

**Induction Steps:**

Total degree: $$2e$$

Average degree:=$$\frac {2e} {v} \leq \frac {2(3v-6)} {v} \leq 6-\frac {12} {v}$$

<mark style="color:$warning;">There exists a vertex with degree < 6 or at most 5. (if not, then average degree will larger or equal than 5)</mark>

Remove vertex v of degree at most 5.

<mark style="color:$danger;">Inductively color remaining graph with 6 colors.</mark>

Color is available for v since only five neighbors...

and only five colors are used.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can see the progress  as program

You know you can find a vetex with degree 5, and you can remove it

You know you can do the recursive call on the graph with fewer vertexes, proper colored

Then you put the removed vetex back to the graph, and you know how to fix the corloring.

You do the recursive leap of faith, then do the work to make extended solution to this one node.
{% endhint %}

## Five color theorem: prelimnary.

**Preliminary Observation: Connected components of vertices with two colors in a legal coloring can switch colors.**

Look at only green and blue.

Connected components.

Can switch in one component.

Or the other.

## Five color theorem

Theorem: Every planar graph can be colored with five colors.

**Preliminary Observation:** Connected components of vertices with two colors in a legal coloring can switch colors.

Proof:&#x20;

**Base case:** For vertex $$\leq 5$$, can be colored with 5 colors

**Induction Hypothesis:** Every planar graph with $$v \geq 5$$ can be colored with six colors.

**Induction Steps:**

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:$warning;">There exists a vertex with degree < 6 or at most 5. (if not, then average degree will larger or equal than 5)</mark>
{% endhint %}

Again with the degree 5 vertex.

* Case 1: <mark style="color:$danger;">Assume neighbors are colored with 4 or less colors, then</mark> one of 5 colors is available.⇒ Done!
* Case 2: <mark style="color:$danger;">Assume neighbors are colored all differently.</mark>&#x20;
  * For blue and green neighbors:
    * Case 2-1: Green and blue are not in a connected component ⇒ Switch green and blue in green’s component. ⇒ Transfered to case 1, then center could colored in green, Done!
    * Case 2-2: Green and blue are in a connected component.
  * For orange and red neighbors:
    * Case 2-3: Orange and red are not in a connected component ⇒ Switch orange and red in orange’s component. ⇒ Transfered to case 1, then center could colored in orange, Done!
    * Case 2-4: Orange and red are in a connected component.
  * Total four combinations, case 2-1 & case 2-3, case 2-1 & case 2-4, case 2-2 & case 2-3, case 2-2 and case 2-4. Only case 2-2 & case 2-4 will lead to the result that all five neighbors must be colored in five different colors.
    * Planar ⇒ paths intersect at a vertex!
    * What color is it?
      * Must be blue or green to be on that path.
      * Must be red or orange to be on that path.
    * <mark style="color:$danger;">Contradiction.</mark> Can recolor one of the neighbors.
    * Then case 2-2 & case 2-4 is not valid.
