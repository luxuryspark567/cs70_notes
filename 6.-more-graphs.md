# 6. More Graphs

## Planarity and Euler

These graphs cannot be drawn in the plane without edge crossings.

Euler’s Formula: **v + f= e + 2** for any connected planar drawing.

\= ⇒ for simple planar graphs: e ≤3v−6.

Idea: Face is a cycle in graph of length 3.

Count face-edge incidences to “eliminate” f.

⇒ for bipartite simple planar graphs: e ≤2v−4.

Idea: face is a cycle in graph of length 4.

Count face-edge incidences.

Proved absolutely no drawing can work for these graphs.

So......so ...Cool!

## Euler’s formula.

**Euler: Connected planar graph has v + f= e + 2.**

<mark style="color:$danger;">Proof: Induction on e.</mark>

**Base:** e = 0, v = f= 1.

**Induction Hypothesis:** Connected planar graph with e edges has v + f = e + 2

**Induction Step:**

* If it is a tree. Done.
* If not a tree.
  * Find a cycle. Remove edge.
  * Joins two faces.
  * New graph: v -vertices. e−1 edges. f−1 faces. Planar.
  * v + (f−1) = (e−1) + 2 by induction hypothesis.
  * Therefore v + f= e + 2.

## Graph Coloring.

Given G = (V , E), a coloring of G assigns colors to vertices V where for each edge the endpoints have different colors.

Notice that the last one, has one three colors.

Fewer colors than number of vertices.

**Lemma:** Any graph with maximum degree d can be d + 1 colored.

Proof: True for 1 vertex. Color n vertex graph with d + 1 colors?

Remove vertex, v.

Color remaining graph with d + 1 colors by induction hypothesis.

Set of neighbors of v use at most d colors,

one color is available for v.

Last graph:

Fewer colors than max degree node.

Interesting things to do. Algorithm!

## Planar graphs and maps.

Planar graph coloring ≡map coloring.

Four color theorem is about planar graphs!

## Six color theorem.

Theorem: Every planar graph can be colored with six colors.

Proof:

Recall: $$e ≤3v−6$$ for any planar graph where v > 2. From Euler’s Formula.

**Base Cases:** for $$v \leq 6$$ can be colored with 6

**Induction Hypothesis:** Every planar graph with $$v \geq 6$$ can be colored with six colors.

**Induction Steps:**

Total degree: $$2e$$

Average degree:=$$\frac {2e} {v} \leq \frac {2(3v-6)} {v} \leq 6-\frac {12} {v}$$

<mark style="color:$warning;">There exists a vertex with degree < 6 or at most 5. (if not, then average degree will larger or equal than 5)</mark>

Remove vertex v of degree at most 5.

<mark style="color:$danger;">Inductively color remaining graph with 6 colors.</mark>

Color is available for v since only five neighbors...

and only five colors are used.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can see the progress  as program

You know you can find a vetex with degree 5, and you can remove it

You know you can do the recursive call on the graph with fewer vertexes, proper colored

Then you put the removed vetex back to the graph, and you know how to fix the corloring.

You do the recursive leap of faith, then do the work to make extended solution to this one node.
{% endhint %}

## Five color theorem: prelimnary.

**Preliminary Observation: Connected components of vertices with two colors in a legal coloring can switch colors.**

Look at only green and blue.

Connected components.

Can switch in one component.

Or the other.

## Five color theorem

Theorem: Every planar graph can be colored with five colors.

**Preliminary Observation:** Connected components of vertices with two colors in a legal coloring can switch colors.

Proof:&#x20;

**Base case:** For vertex $$\leq 5$$, can be colored with 5 colors

**Induction Hypothesis:** Every planar graph with $$v \geq 5$$ can be colored with six colors.

**Induction Steps:**

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:$warning;">There exists a vertex with degree < 6 or at most 5. (if not, then average degree will larger or equal than 5)</mark>
{% endhint %}

Again with the degree 5 vertex.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (40).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Case 1: <mark style="color:$danger;">Assume neighbors are colored with 4 or less colors, then</mark> one of 5 colors is available.⇒ Done!
* Case 2: <mark style="color:$danger;">Assume neighbors are colored all differently.</mark>&#x20;
  * For blue and green neighbors:
    * Case 2-1: There is no green and blue path to blue ⇒ Switch green and blue in green’s component. ⇒ Transfered to case 1, then center could colored in green, Done!
    * Case 2-2: There is a green and blue path to blue.
  * For orange and red neighbors:
    * Case 2-3: There is no orange and red path to red ⇒ Switch orange and red in orange’s component. ⇒ Transfered to case 1, then center could colored in orange, Done!
    * Case 2-4: There is an orange and red path to red.
  * Total four combinations, case 2-1 & case 2-3, case 2-1 & case 2-4, case 2-2 & case 2-3, case 2-2 and case 2-4. <mark style="color:red;">Only case 2-2 & case 2-4 will lead to the result that all five neighbors must be colored in five different colors.</mark>
    * Planar ⇒ <mark style="color:$danger;">paths intersect at a vertex</mark>!
    * What color is it?
      * Must be blue or green to be on that path.
      * Must be red or orange to be on that path.
    * <mark style="color:$danger;">Contradiction.</mark> Can recolor one of the neighbors.
    * Then case 2-2 & case 2-4 is not valid.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**What is a blue-green path?**

A path with only blue and green, and blue and green alternates.

**Why there is a blue-green path, and a orange-red path? Why not blue-red-green?**

Becausea blue-green path will guarantee that green neighbor and blue neighbor must be in different colors, otherwise we could just switch green and blue in green's component, or in blue's component, to make the neighbors of the degree 5 vetex be colored in 4 colors, and then it could be colored in green or blue.

## Complete Graph.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Every pair of vetices are connected by an edge.**

$$K_n$$ complete graph on n vertices.

All edges are present.

Everyone is my neighbor.

Each vertex is adjacent to every other vertex.

**How many edges?**

Each vertex is incident to n−1 edges.

Sum of degrees is n(n−1) = 2|E|

⇒ Number of edges is n(n−1)/2.



## Tree

Definitions:

A connected graph without a cycle.

A connected graph with |V |−1 edges.

A connected graph where any edge removal disconnects it.

A connected graph where any edge addition creates a cycle.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

no cycle and connected? Yes.

|V |−1 edges and connected? Yes.

removing any edge disconnects it. Harder to check. but yes.

Adding any edge creates cycle. Harder to check. but yes.

## Equivalence of Definitions.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To proof I want to use recursion.

And to use recursion, I want to take a vertex away.
{% endhint %}

**Theorem:**

“G connected and has |V |−1 edges” ≡

“G is connected and has no cycles.”

**Lemma:** If v has degree 1 in connected graph G, G−v is connected.

**Proof:**

For x ̸= v , y ̸= v ∈V ,

there is (simple) path between x and y in G since connected.

and does not use v (degree 1) (all the vetex must have at least degree of 2, to get in and get out)

⇒ G−v is connected.

## Proof of only if.

**Thm:**

“G connected and has |V |−1 edges” ≡

“G is connected and has no cycles.”

Proof of= ⇒: By induction on |V |.

**Base Case:** |V |= 1. 0= |V |−1 edges and has no cycles.

**Induction Step:**

**Claim:** There is a degree 1 node.

* **Proof:** First, connected ⇒ every vertex degree ≥1.
* Sum of degrees is $$2|V|−2$$
* Average degree $$2−2/|V|$$
* **Not everyone is bigger than average!**

By degree 1 removal lemma, G−v is connected.

G−v has |V |−1 vertices and |V |−2 edges so by induction

⇒ no cycle in G−v.

And no cycle in G since degree 1 cannot participate in cycle.

## Proof of if

Thm:

“G is connected and has no cycles”

⇒ “G connected and has |V |−1 edges”

Proof:

Walk from a vertex using untraversed edges.

Until get stuck.

Claim: Degree 1 vertex.

* Proof of Claim:
* Can’t visit more than once since no cycle.
* Entered. Didn’t leave. Only one incident edge.

Removing node doesn’t create cycle.

New graph is connected.

Removing degree 1 node doesn’t disconnect from Degree 1 lemma.

By induction G−v has |V |−2 edges.

G has one more or |V |−1 edges.

## Tree’s fall apart.

Thm: There is one vertex whose removal disconnects |V |/2 nodes from each other.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Idea of proof.

Point edge toward bigger side.

Remove center node.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Hypercubes.

Complete graphs, really connected! But lots of edges.

$$|V|(|V|−1)/2$$

Trees, few edges. ($$|V|−1$$)

but just falls apart!

Hypercubes. Really connected. |V |log|V |edges!

Also represents bit-strings nicely.

$$G = (V , E)$$

$$|V|= \{0, 1\}^d$$

$$|E|= \{(x, y )|x \space and \space y \space differ \space in \space one \space bit \space position.\}$$

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

$$2^d$$ vertices. number of d -bit strings!

$$d 2^{d−1}$$ edges.

$$2^d$$ vertices each of degree $$d$$

total degree is $$d 2^d$$ and half as many edges!
