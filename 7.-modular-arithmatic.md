# 7. Modular Arithmatic

## Isoperimetry.

For 3-space:

The sphere minimizes <mark style="color:$warning;">surface area to volume</mark>.

Surface Area: $$4πr^2$$, Volume: $$\frac {4} {3} πr^3$$

Ratio: $$1/3r = Θ(V^{−1/3})$$.

<mark style="color:$warning;">Graphical Analog</mark>: <mark style="color:$warning;">Cut into two pieces and find ratio of edges/vertices</mark> <mark style="color:$warning;"></mark><mark style="color:$warning;">**on small side**</mark><mark style="color:$warning;">.</mark>

* Tree: $$Θ(1/|V|)$$.
* Hypercube: $$Θ(1)$$.

## Recursive Definition.

A 0-dimensional hypercube is a node labelled with the empty string of bits.

An <mark style="color:$warning;">n-dimensional hypercube</mark> consists of a 0-subcube (1-subcube) which is a <mark style="color:$warning;">n−1-dimensional hypercube</mark> with nodes labelled 0x (1x) with the additional edges (0x, 1x).

* One hypercube on the left, and each vertex is labeled with a additional 0 ahead;
* One hypercube on the right, and each vertex is labeled with a additional 1 ahead;
* And edges connect each vertices on the left hypercube to the right one.

## Hypercube: Can’t cut me!

**Thm**: Any <mark style="color:$warning;">subset</mark> $$S$$ of the hypercube where $$|S|≤|V|/2$$ has $$≥|S|$$ edges connecting it to $$V−S$$; $$|E∩S ×(V−S)|≥|S|$$

**Terminology**:

* $$(S, V−S)$$ is cut.
* $$(E∩S ×(V−S))$$ - cut edges. (All the edges connect $$S$$ to $$V-S$$, which are cut edges)

**Restatement**: for any cut in the hypercube, the number of cut edges is at least the size of the small side.

No better than this cut if half-half.

## Proof of Large Cuts.

Thm: For any <mark style="color:$warning;">cut</mark> $$(S, V−S)$$ in the hypercube, the number of <mark style="color:$warning;">cut edges</mark> is at least the size of the small side.

**Proof**:

**Base Case**: $$n = 1$$, $$V = \{0,1\}$$.

$$S= \{0\}$$ has one edge leaving. $$|S|= φ$$ has 0.

**Analyse**:

Use recursive definition into two subcubes.

Two cubes connected by edges.

Case 1: Count edges inside subcube inductively.

Case 2: Count inside and across.

{% hint style="info" %}
In case 1, I can apply induction;

In case 2, I assume one of the side is bigger than half, so I can't apply induction, so I then apply the induction to argue about that the cut edges is three parts added.
{% endhint %}

## **Induction Step. Case 1**

Recursive definition:

$$H$$ for <mark style="color:$warning;">hypercube</mark>, $$V$$ for <mark style="color:$warning;">vertex</mark>, $$E$$ for <mark style="color:$warning;">edge</mark>, and $$S$$ for <mark style="color:$warning;">subcube (a subcube is a collection of vertices, which is a subset of</mark> $$V$$<mark style="color:$warning;">)</mark>.

* $$H_0 = (V_0, E_0)$$, $$H_1 = (V_1, E_1)$$, edges $$E_x$$ that connect them.
* $$H = (V_0 ∪ V_1, E_0 ∪ E_1 ∪ E_x)$$, Hypercube is a collection of all the vertices and edges connect each them.
* $$S = S_0 ∪ S_1$$ where $$S_0$$ in first, and $$S_1$$ in other.

<mark style="color:blue;">Case 1</mark>: $$|S_0|≤|V_0|/2$$, $$|S_1|≤|V_1|/2$$

Left one is $$H_0$$, and right one is $$H_1$$.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image.png" alt="" width="330"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Both $$S_0$$ and $$S_1$$ are small sides. So by induction:

* Edges cut in $$H_0 ≥ |S_0|$$.
* Edges cut in $$H_1 ≥ |S_1|$$.

Total cut edges $$≥|S_0|+ |S_1|= |S|$$.

{% hint style="info" %}
What is the induction hypothesis here?

For any cut $$(S, V−S)$$ in the hypercube smaller than $$H$$, the number of cut edges is at least the size of the small side.
{% endhint %}

## Induction Step. Case 2.

**Thm**: For any cut (S, V−S) in the hypercube, the number of cut edges is at least the size of the small side, |S|.

**Proof: Induction Step. Case 2.**

{% hint style="info" %}
1, Why is $$S_0$$ is more than half, and $$S_1$$ must be less than half?

$$S_0 + S_1$$ <mark style="color:$success;">is less than half by definition</mark>, then if $$S_0$$ is more than half, then $$S_1$$ must be less than half.



2, There is an err in the picture below, is $$V_0-S_0$$ and $$V_1-S_1$$?

Not really.

(1) $$V_0-S$$ is the vertices that left in $$H_0$$ by cut $$S$$ from $$H$$, the vertices connect $$S_0$$ and $$V_0 - S$$ is $$≥|V_0|−|S_0|$$.

(2) $$V_1-S$$ is the vertices that left in $$H_1$$ by cut $$S$$ from $$H$$, the vertices connect $$S_1$$ and $$V_1 - S$$ is $$≥|S_1|$$.

(3) And in order to cut $$S$$ from $$H$$, $$|S_0|−|S_1|$$ edges that connects $$S_0$$ and $$V_1 - S$$ would also need to be cut.
{% endhint %}

* $$|S_0|≥|V_0|/2$$.
  * Recall Case 1: $$|S_0|, |S_1|≤|V|/2$$
  * then $$|S_1|≤|V_1|/2$$ since $$|S|≤|V |/2$$.&#x20;
  * ⇒ $$≥|S_1|$$edges cut in $$E_1$$.
* $$|S_0|≥|V_0|/2$$ ⇒$$|V_0−S|≤|V_0|/2$$
  * ⇒ $$≥|V_0|−|S_0|$$edges cut in $$E_0$$. (There a some extra edges connect $$S_0$$ to $$V_1-S$$)
* Edges in $$E_x$$ connect corresponding nodes.
  * ⇒ $$= |S_0|−|S_1|$$edges cut in $$E_x$$.

Total edges cut:

$$≥ |S_1|+ |V_0|−|S_0|+ |S_0|−|S_1|= |V_0|$$

$$|V_0|= |V|/2 ≥|S|$$.

Also, case 3 where $$|S_1|≥|V|/2$$ is symmetric.



Hypercubes and Boolean Functions.

The cuts in the hypercubes are exactly the transitions from 0 sets to 1

set on boolean functions on $$\{0, 1\}^n$$.

Central area of study in computer science!

Why are obsessed with hypercubes?

The hypercube is a zero-one strings. And to study which subset of vertices do you label one, and which subset of vertices do you label zero, is central to computer science.
