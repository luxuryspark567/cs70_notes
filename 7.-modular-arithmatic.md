# 7. Modular Arithmatic

## Isoperimetry.

For 3-space:

The sphere minimizes <mark style="color:$warning;">surface area to volume</mark>.

Surface Area: $$4πr^2$$, Volume: $$\frac {4} {3} πr^3$$

Ratio: $$1/3r = Θ(V^{−1/3})$$.

<mark style="color:$warning;">Graphical Analog</mark>: <mark style="color:$warning;">Cut into two pieces and find ratio of edges/vertices</mark> <mark style="color:$warning;"></mark><mark style="color:$warning;">**on small side**</mark><mark style="color:$warning;">.</mark>

* Tree: $$Θ(1/|V|)$$.
* Hypercube: $$Θ(1)$$.

## Recursive Definition.

A 0-dimensional hypercube is a node labelled with the empty string of bits.

An <mark style="color:$warning;">n-dimensional hypercube</mark> consists of a 0-subcube (1-subcube) which is a <mark style="color:$warning;">n−1-dimensional hypercube</mark> with nodes labelled 0x (1x) with the additional edges (0x, 1x).

* One hypercube on the left, and each vertex is labeled with a additional 0 ahead;
* One hypercube on the right, and each vertex is labeled with a additional 1 ahead;
* And edges connect each vertices on the left hypercube to the right one.

## Hypercube: Can’t cut me!

**Thm**: Any <mark style="color:$warning;">subset</mark> $$S$$ of the hypercube where $$|S|≤|V|/2$$ has $$≥|S|$$ edges connecting it to $$V−S$$; $$|E∩S ×(V−S)|≥|S|$$

**Terminology**:

* $$(S, V−S)$$ is cut.
* $$(E∩S ×(V−S))$$ - cut edges. (All the edges connect $$S$$ to $$V-S$$, which are cut edges)

**Restatement**: for any cut in the hypercube, the number of cut edges is at least the size of the small side.

No better than this cut if half-half.

## Proof of Large Cuts.

Thm: For any <mark style="color:$warning;">cut</mark> $$(S, V−S)$$ in the hypercube, the number of <mark style="color:$warning;">cut edges</mark> is at least the size of the small side.

**Proof**:

**Base Case**: $$n = 1$$, $$V = \{0,1\}$$.

$$S= \{0\}$$has one edge leaving. $$|S|= φ$$ has 0.

**Analyse**:

Use recursive definition into two subcubes.

Two cubes connected by edges.

Case 1: Count edges inside subcube inductively.

Case 2: Count inside and across.

{% hint style="info" %}
In case 1, I can apply induction;

In case 2, I assume one of the side is bigger than half, so I can't apply induction, so I then apply the induction to argue about that the cut edges is three parts added.
{% endhint %}

**Induction Step**:

Recursive definition:

$$H$$ for hypercube, $$V$$ for vertices, $$E$$ for edges, and $$S$$ for sides<mark style="color:$danger;">???</mark>.

* $$H_0 = (V_0, E_0)$$, $$H_1 = (V_1, E_1)$$, edges $$E_x$$ that connect them.
* $$H = (V_0 ∪ V_1, E_0 ∪ E_1 ∪ E_x)$$
* $$S = S_0 ∪ S_1$$ where $$S_0$$ in first, and $$S_1$$ in other.

<mark style="color:blue;">Case 1</mark>: $$|S_0|≤|V_0|/2$$, $$|S_1|≤|V_1|/2$$

Both $$S_0$$ and $$S_1$$ are small sides. So by induction.

Edges cut in $$H_0 ≥ |S_0|$$.

Edges cut in $$H_1 ≥ |S_1|$$.

Total cut edges $$≥|S_0|+ |S_1|= |S|$$.
